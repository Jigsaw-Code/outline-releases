[^1]: If the Outline Client is side loaded by directly downloading and installing the APK file, the app will not receive automatic updates and will need to be updated manually to take advantage of the latest features. In order to install the app, you may need to change your Settings to allow installation of unknown apps. After installing Outline, it is recommended to immediately change the setting back to disabling installation of unknown apps. This helps prevent installing potentially harmful or malicious apps from unsafe sources.
